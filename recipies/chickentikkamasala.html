    <h2 align="center">Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Chicken Tikka Masala</strong> is a popular dish that originates from South Asian cuisine, though it has
        become a hallmark
        of <b>British-Indian</b> fusion. It consists of marinated, grilled pieces of chicken (tikka) that are then
        simmered in
        a creamy, tomato-based sauce seasoned with a blend of spices such as cumin, turmeric, and garam masala. The
        rich, mildly spiced sauce is often thickened with yogurt or cream, giving the dish a smooth, velvety texture.
        Chicken Tikka Masala is typically served with naan bread or rice, making it a flavorful and hearty meal.
        <br><br>

        The origins of <em>Chicken Tikka Masala</em> are widely debated, with some attributing it to Indian chefs in the
        <b>UK</b> who
        adapted traditional recipes to suit British tastes. It has since become a beloved staple in Indian restaurants
        across the globe. The dish reflects the blending of traditional Indian culinary techniques with Western
        preferences for rich, creamy sauces, embodying the evolution of globalized cuisine. Its popularity is a
        testament to how food can bridge cultural boundaries, blending diverse flavors into a single, harmonious dish.

        <li>Pour crushed tomatoes into the skillet. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the
            bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, reduce
            heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and sauce is slightly reduced,
            about 15 minutes.</li>
