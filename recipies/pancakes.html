    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around
        delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much
        better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a
        starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle
        or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten
        in prehistoric societies.[1]
        <br><br>
        The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In England, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a
        crêpe.[2] In Scotland and North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick
        fluffy pancake. A crêpe is a thin pancake of Breton origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe
        maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is
        palatschinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground
        walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <li> Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li><br>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li><br>
        <li>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li><br>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li><br>
        <li> Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li><br>
        <li>Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together. </li><br>
